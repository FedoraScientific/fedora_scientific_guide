Numerical Computing Tools
-------------------------

GNU Octave
==========

*GNU Octave* is a high level programming language and numerical
computing environment. It is mostly compatible with MATLAB. Hence, if
you are looking for a MATLAB alternative on Fedora Scientific, GNU Octave
may be the place to start.

Official documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GNU Octave manual is `here
<http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/index.html>`__
with a `PDF <http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/octave.pdf>`__ version
also available.

Other ways to get help are mentioned `here

Scilab
======

*Scilab* combines a high level programming language and a numerical
 computing environment. If you have prior experience with MATLAB and
 are looking for something similar, `Scilab
 <http://help.scilab.org/docs/5.4.1/fr_FR/section_36184e52ee88ad558380be4e92d3de21.html>`__
 is worth looking into.
