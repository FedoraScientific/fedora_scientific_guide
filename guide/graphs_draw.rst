Graphics and Plotting
---------------------

gnuplot
=======

`gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`__ is a command line driven
utility for creating 2-D and 3-D graphs. The official documentation is
available `here <http://www.gnuplot.info/documentation.html>`__. The `brief tutorial
<http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/gnuplot.html>`__ here may also be a
good starting point.

The user mailing list is linked from the `Help
<http://www.gnuplot.info/help.html>`__ page.

XFig
====

Besides creating drawings in `XFig <http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/>`__,
one way I find it really useful is in using it to process exported
graphs from `gnuplot`. Plots created in `gnuplot` can be exported in a
format called the `fig` format (among others). Once exported in this
format, you can then open it in `XFig`, make any changes to it
(including using `LaTeX formulas <http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/infrastructure/howto/xfig_latex.html>`__)
and export it to one of the `supported formats <http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/>`__.

Inkscape
========

`Inkscape <http://www.inkscape.org/en/>`__ is a `feature rich
<http://www.inkscape.org/en/about/features/>`__ vector image creation
tool. There are a number of `tutorials
<http://www.inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/>`__ for getting started
and various mailing lists for seeking help and discussions are listed
`here <http://www.inkscape.org/en/community/mailing-lists/>`__. 

dia
===

`Dia <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/>`__ can be used to create
diagrams and supports exporting to a number of other formats. A
mailing list is available `here
<https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/dia-list>`__.
