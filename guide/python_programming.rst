Python libraries and related software
-------------------------------------

Fedora Scientific includes the widely used Python libraries and
tools for scientific and numerical computing. Specifically, most of
the core components of the `SciPy stack
<http://www.scipy.org/about.html>`__  (Numpy and Scipy libraries,
Matplotlib, Sympy and IPython are included). With the exception of
SymPy, you will find that the Python 3 equivalents are also installed.

SciPy
=====

The official documentation for the SciPy and Numpy libraries are `here
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`__. The `Python Scientific Lecture notes
<http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`__ may be useful too. 

You can seek help from the mailing lists for both SciPy and Numpy
`here <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/mailing-lists.html>`__. 

SymPy
=====

SymPy is a library for symbolic math. The official documentation for
SymPy is `here <http://docs.sympy.org>`__. 

The user mailing list is `here
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sympy>`__. 

IPython
=======

IPython is an enhanced interactive shell with various features to
support rapid interactive computing. The IPython Notebook is a browser
based environment which allows you to create rich JSON based documents
embedding rich text, numerical calculations and inline graphs. See the
IPython `homepage <http://ipython.org/>`__ to learn more. 

The official documentation is `here
<http://ipython.org/documentation.html>`__. There are also a number of
`talks and presentations <http://ipython.org/presentation.html>`__ and
`videos and screencasts <http://ipython.org/videos.html#videos>`__. 

The IPython mailing list is `here
<http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/>`__.

Plotting
========

Matplotlib is the most feature-rich Python library for creating
publication ready graphs and figures.

The official documentation is `here
<http://matplotlib.org/contents.html>`__ and the `example gallery
<http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html>`__ has a large number of
examples of creating plots of all kinds using matplotlib.
