Python libraries and related software
-------------------------------------

Fedora Scientific includes the widely used Python libraries and
tools for scientific and numerical computing. Specifically, most of
the core components of the `SciPy stack
<http://www.scipy.org/about.html>`__  (Numpy and Scipy libraries,
Matplotlib, Sympy and IPython are included). With the exception of
SymPy, you will find that the Python 3 equivalents are also installed.

SciPy
=====

The official documentation for the SciPy and Numpy libraries are `here
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`__. The `Python Scientific Lecture notes
<http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`__ may be useful too. 

You can seek help from the mailing lists for both SciPy and Numpy
`here <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/mailing-lists.html>`__. 

SymPy
=====

SymPy is a library for symbolic math. The official documentation for
SymPy is `here <http://docs.sympy.org>`__. 

The user mailing list is `here
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sympy>`__. 

IPython
