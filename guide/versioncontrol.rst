Version control
---------------

Fedora Scientific includes several popular version control software.

git
===

`Pro Git <http://www.git-scm.com/book>`__ by Scott Chacon is a freely
available online book that should get you started with Git (in case you are
not familiar with it) and also be a handy reference after you are
familiar with the basics.

Other documentation including the man pages are listed `here
<http://www.git-scm.com/documentation>`__. 

The `Git user mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-users>`__ is
an active community where you can ask your queries if you get stuck.

Mercurial
=========

`Learning Mercurial in Workflows
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide>`__ is a good starting point if
you are not familiar with Mercurial. The page also links to a
`tutorial <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/Tutorial>`__ 
and other resources for learning more about it.

The user mailing list is `here
<http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/>`__.


Subversion
==========

`Rapid SVN <http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/>`__  - a GUI front-end for the
Subversion version control system is included. The documentation `here
<http://www.rapidsvn.org/index.php/OnlineHelp:Contents>`__ should be a
good starting point in case you are not familiar with it.

A `user forum
<http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=671>`__
is available for seeking help.
