LaTeX
-----

Fedora Scientific includes the complete toolchain needed for
creating documents using LaTeX. Besides using text editors such as
Emacs or Vim, users also have the option of using `Kile
<http://kile.sourceforge.net/>`__ - an integrated LaTeX
Environment. The LaTeX package, `beamer
<http://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer>`__ is also included to assist in
creating presentations with LaTeX. 

Utilities such as `hevea <http://hevea.inria.fr/>`__ and `bibtex2html
<http://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer>`__ are also included.
