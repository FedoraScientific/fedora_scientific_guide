R programming
-------------

Fedora Scientific includes `R
<http://www.r-project.org/index.html>`__ - a software environment for
statistical computing. The `R manuals
<http://www.r-project.org/index.html>`__ are a good place to get
started as well as extensive documentaion on R. The `R-help
<https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help>`__ is a mailing list
which can be used to seek help on R.

`rkward <http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/rkward/>`__ - a GUI for
R is also installed.
